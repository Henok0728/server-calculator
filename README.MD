# A SERVER CALCULATOR PROJECT
-This projects aims to give basic understanding of java socket programming, which demonstrates the connections between client and server which client requests a request and the server handles the request which is able to process it and resend it back to the client , in this project which is calculator the client sends two numbers to be added or subtracted and the server handle the request by calculating the request sent to client , but the client and the server must be connected to the same port and have same Ip address to connect other than that it doesn't work.

# Steps to work with it
1. Clone the code
2. Run the server and the client side code with the different pc.
3. Connect the server pc and the client pc with the same ip address which the ip address must be written to the client, until the updates coming.
4. Run both files both will be connected which you can request as the client through the gui and the server as CLI.
